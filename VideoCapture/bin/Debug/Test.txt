Through recent advances in mobile sensing, the collection of data throughout everyday life is now possible with the use of unobtrusive, wearable systems. In parallel with these technological advances, there is a growing societal interest in personal informatics and ‘quantified self’ movements, where individuals use modern tracking tools to quantitatively assess and manage their own health.
Our work focuses on the development of an effective feedback to create the desired. This task is heavily interdisciplinary – attempting to apply concepts from fields such as engineering, computer science, psychology and others. To further complicate matters, existing research varies greatly in application due to both the complexity of the system required to test human-in-the loop feedback, and the variety of feedback methodologies. Our solution to this problem utilizes recent research findings on the effect user avatars in virtual environments can have on their real-world counterparts.

We are working to create systems which allow the use of mobile virtual avatars to serve as an intuitive, ubiquitous display in order to help motivate positive change in users’ lives. These avatars can be programmed to react to user behavior as measured by wearable or mobile phone sensors. In this way, we are able to leverage the sub-conscious effects experienced by users when interacting with their avatars.

Our studies aim to better characterize the complex bond formed between users and their avatars, so that we may enable the creation of very motivating feedback mechanisms which the general public can use to help improve their health without the need of medical intervention.
Emerging findings from the immersive virtual environments and games literature indicate avatars exert subtle psychological influence on their real-world counterparts One such effect – the Proteus Effect – causes the subject to alter their behavior and perception of themselves so that it better matches with their avatar. Thus, by creating a desired trait in the avatar, users can be influenced.

The USF PIE lab is running a study to measure the Proteus effect via a set of mobile phone applications. Our study’s avatar is made up of a simple cartoon animation with the subject’s

face superimposed. In order to automate the avatar creation process, we have created an application makes use of facial recognition technology to extract the subject’s face from a photo. We can then display avatars of varying physical activity levels on the user’s phone background. Using a within-subject comparison of active/passive avatar levels and user activity measured from accelerometers and GPS, we hope to provide quantitative evidence of avatar influence over user behavior. A successful demonstration of the Proteus effect in this context could alter the face of behavior change therapy and help people live healthier lives throughout the growing reach of mobile devices.

The potential applications of avatar feedback are exciting, but it is important to note that there is still a great deal which remains unknown about the avatar effects researchers have uncovered and about human-avatar interactions in general.
